# A_module_for_work_with_CSV_files_and_BD
The module reads files and creates a collection of objects in JVM based on these data.
Writes all these data to a database (the database is created independently, based on logical data types).
Make a few analytical samples from the database. Make changes to the database.
Records analytical samples in files.

In order for the module to work, you need to manually create a database in Dbiaver.
In the file appProperties.txt specify the path to the database.
